# vdcd configuration
if PACKAGE_vdcd

config VDCD_OLA
	bool "Include OLA support"
	default n
  help
    Enabling this includes support for OLA (Open Lighting Architecture).
    If enabled, vdcd depends on package ola

config VDCD_UBUS
	bool "Include ubus support"
	default n
  help
    Enabling this includes support for ubus API

config VDCD_I2C
	bool "Include i2c support"
	default y
  help
    Enabling this includes support for I2C based devices, requiring libi2c

config VDCD_EV
	bool "Base Mainloop on libev"
	default n
  help
    Enabling this makes the mainloop use libev for I/O polling which allows
    using features that are libev-based such as UWSC websockets.
    If enabled, vdcd depends on libev

config VDCD_UWSC
  depends on VDCD_EV
	bool "Include uwsc (websocket) support"
	default n
  help
    Enabling this includes support for websocket clients in p44script
    If enabled, vdcd depends on package libuwsc

config VDCD_LVGL
	bool "Include lvgl (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) support"
	default n
  help
    Enabling this includes support for creating lvgl based interactive UIs
    in p44script. Works for linux /dev/fb0 and /dev/input/event0

config VDCD_RRDB
	bool "Include rrd(tool) support for logging sensor data"
	default n
  help
    Enabling this includes support for librrd (round robin database, rrdtool).
    If enabled, vdcd depends on package librrd1

config VDCD_PNG
	bool "Include PNG support for advanced LED chain light effects"
	default n
  help
    Enabling this includes support for displaying PNG images in LED matrix lights.
    If enabled, vdcd depends on package libpng

config VDCD_RPIWS281X
  depends on TARGET_bcm27xx_bcm2708_DEVICE_rpi || TARGET_bcm27xx_bcm2709_DEVICE_rpi-2 || TARGET_bcm27xx_bcm2710_DEVICE_rpi-3
	bool "Include support for WS281x LED-chains"
	default n
	help
    Enabling this makes ledchain support use RaspberryPi-specific
    hardware (instead relying on a kernel driver like p44-ledchain)

config VDCD_P44FEATURES
	bool "Include support for p44features (specific usecase drivers)"
	default n
  help
    Enabling this includes support for p44features, a set of drivers for
    very specific peripheral hardware and use cases for exhibitions & art project.

config VDCD_DS485
	bool "Include dS485 support"
	default n
  help
    Enabling this includes support for dS485 (dS classic direct control)

config VDCD_PLATFORM_SHORTBREAK
	bool "platform can do short (2mS) UART break"
	default n
  help
    Enabling this makes DMX512 implementation rely on tcsendbreak(fd, milliseconds)
    to actually work and produce a break not longer than 2ms when passed 2 as second arg.
    This is not the case e.g. for MT7688 SoC, so if this option is not set there is
    a fallback to ugly custom baudrate tricks to emulate a short break
    (which pollute the kernel log with warnings and may fail in future kernels).

config VDCD_MODBUS
	bool "Include modbus support"
	default n
  help
    Enabling this includes support for modbus

config VDCD_EMBEDDED_LIBMODBUS
  depends on VDCD_MODBUS
	bool "embed libmodbus statically"
	default y
  help
    Enabling this embeds libmodbus by building it from the enhanced version
    in p44utils, rather than using the standard libmodbus.
    Note: this is required until the additions to libmodbus are accepted upstream.
